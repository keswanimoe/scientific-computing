# A Collection of Scientific Algorithms
I completed these in my second year of university studying Mathematics.

The emphasis of this module was focused on practical knowledge of algorithms, as well as the methods for error estimation and analysis.

In this module, I was introduced to the most widely used methods and algorithms, for example:

- Solution of linear and nonlinear equations
- Polynomial and piece-wise polynomial interpolation
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Numerical differentiation and integration
- Linear least-squares approximation
- Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations

I completed these using *MATLAB*.
