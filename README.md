# A Collection of Scientific Algorithms
A collection of university assignments I completed in my second year studying Mathematics

The emphasis of this module was focusing on practical knowledge of algorithms, as well as the methods for error estimation and analysis.

In this module I was introduced to the most widely used methods and algorithms, for example:

Solution of linear and nonlinear equations
Polynomial and piece-wise polynomial interpolation
Fast Fourier Transform
Numerical differentiation and integration
Linear least-squares approximation
Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations

I completed these using *MATLAB*.
